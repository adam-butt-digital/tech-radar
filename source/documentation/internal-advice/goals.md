# Goals

These goals highlight the primary outcomes that the organisation expects to achieve through it's architecture. Unfortunately there does not appear to be any statement of these goals within official documentation, so the goals below are largely reverse-engineered / inferred from past behaviours and conversations rather than being definitively stated by the organisation.  Additionally we are colliding goals from different spaces within the architecture.

* Respond to change quickly
* Provide a safe and secure online experience
* Make interactions 'Digital by Default'
* Reduce cost
* Evidence-based decision-making
* Availability
* Resilience
* Scalability
* Re-usability
* “Cloud First” hosting approach to reduce infrastructure cost and increase maintainability
* Use Open Standard, open source software to reduce software licensing costs (Trusted providers, Inspectable code)
* Limit Commercial/Vendor/Supplier Tie-in
* Small, Isolated Components – relatively easy to swap in/out
