# API First #


## Goals ##

Make the micro-services consumable for various devices, applications including your own customer facing services by providing APIs.

## Rational ##

The transition from being online to being mobile and digital has been very rapid and so service providers have a constant race with technology transformation. UX patterns today may be obsolete in a few months. With APIs, this change can be controlled to the consumer facing service rather than the core services. With APIs, organisations can focus on their strategy along with customer focus.

## Implications ##

API first requires its own disciplined development approach to delivery of digital services. This principle also requires a strong focus on the big picture or architecture strategy along with the design of the services. In short term, it may lead to extra effort being put into services, but many times data served by services to internal customers finds it use in some dashboard driving metrics of growth. API channel will also adhere to the same access controls prescribed for microservices.
