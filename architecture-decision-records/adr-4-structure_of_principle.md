# ADR 4: Structure of a principle

# Context

We need consistency in terms of format and structure for our patterns across the customer facing, integration and other architectures.
We are also keen to link back to business strategy directly so we can isolate points for consideration in design, implementsation and assessment.

# Decision

We propose the following struture for principle artefacts:

* Context
  * Where possible link to URI's for business strategy identifying bullet points the principle is designed to promote
* Rationale
* Consequences
* Examples (optional)
* Recognised Exceptions (optional)

# Status

Proposed

# Consequences

Stakeholder groups will need to re-factor the format and structure of pattern material in a later editing phase. The first phase is to get the material into the repository.
